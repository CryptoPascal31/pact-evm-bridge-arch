# Pact - EVM Bridge Architecture

## Agents

### User
Wants to interract with blockchains to:
* Wrap nitive tokens from EVM to Kadena
* Unwrap Kadena tokens to EVM

User interract only with the blockchains

User **trust the Owner**.


### Owner
* Must be trusted by the users
* Has indrectily full access to the funds
* Can Pause / Unpause the contracts
* Grants and Revokes the Approvers

Owner **trust the Approvers**

### Approvers
* Daemons running on external servers
* Receive event from one blockchain, and relay to the others.
* Own private keys
* Only interract with the blockchains, never with the users.

Deposit (EVM -> Kadena) and Withdrawal (Kadena -> EVM) functions can be segregated. (ie Some approvers may only handle deposits, while some others may only handle withdrawals)


## Smart Contracts

### On the EVM side (Solidity)
* Custody of the native ERC-20 tokens
* Only handle 1 token type
* Unique contract for both functions



### On the Kadena side (Pact)

On the Kadena side deposits and withdrawals flows are completely independant


#### Deposit/Mint contract
* Receives approvals from the approvers
* Stores the approvals
* When requested by the user, mint the wrapped tokens

#### Withdraw/Burn Contract
* When requested by the user burn the wrapped tokens
* Store the signature provided by the approvers

#### Token contract
* Standard Fungible-v2 or v3 token
* Allow minting and burning
* Keep track of total circulating tokens (total minted - total burnt)


## Deposit Flow

### Setup

1. Each approver generates an unique identifier and a private Key: `K_Deposit_n`

2. Each approver sends its public key to the Owner

3. **Owner** send a transaction to the Deposit Contract to grant the approvers.


### Deposit

1. **User** sends a `Deposit(Amount, Account_Hash)` transaction to the EVM contract.
 * Account_Hash is the Blake2 of the Kadena account


2. During the execution of the contract(on EVM):
  * Funds are being transfered to the contract address
  * An EVM chain event is genereated


3. Each approver sees the event and sends an `(Approve EthTxId Amount Account_Hash)` transaction to the Pact deposit contract. The deposit contract store each approval.
   * Transaction signed with it's `K_Deposit_n`


4. **User** monitors the on-chain data until the required (number defined by **Owner**) number of approvals has been reached.


5. **User** send a `(Claim EthTxId Amount Account)`. The contract:
  * Verifies that enough approvers have approve the transaction.
  * Checks that Hash(Account) == Account_Hash
  * Mints the wrapped tokens
  * Sends the fee to the *Fee Collector* account
  * Sends the token to *Account*

## Withdrawal flow

### Setup

1. Each approver generates an unique identifier and two privates Key: `K_Withdraw_n` and `K_Withdraw_Recover_n`


2. Each approver sends its public keys to the Owner


3. For each approver, **Owner** sends:
  * A transaction to the Pact Withdrawal Contract to grant `K_Withdraw_n`
  * A transaction to the EVM contract to grant `K_Withdraw_Recover_n`


5. **User** sends a `(Claim EthTxId Amount Account)`. The contract:
    * Verifies that enough approvers have approve the transaction.
    * Checks that Hash(Account) == Account_Hash
    * Mints the wrapped tokens
    * Sends the fee to the *Fee Collector* account
    * Sends the token to *Account*




### Withdrawal

1. *User* sends a `(Burn Amount EVM_Address)` to Pact Withdrawal Contract. The contract:
  * Sends the fee to the *Fee Collector* account
  * Burn the wrapped tokens.
  * Generates a Kadena chain event


2. Each approver sees the event and:
  * Generates a signature: `Signature = ECC(KadenaTxId Amount EVM_Address)` with `K_Withdraw_Recover_n`. EIP-712 or something similar can be used.
  * Send a transaction  `(SubmitSignature KadenaTxId Signature)`. Transaction signed with `K_Withdraw_n`
